For many developers, Git is an invaluable tool of any software
development stack. A version control system is a great way
to keep your projects backed up, centralized, tracked, and
accessible to be worked on with others.

GitHub is a website that builds on the functionality of Git,
it hosts your projects in a single place and adds some useful
project tracking features that can be accessed in its easy-to-use
website. You can [make an account here][github-join] and
[sign up for the student discounts here.][gh-student-pack]

Git is (normally) just a console application, but many IDEs
have built in support for git version control tracking.
  - [Git for Visual Studio][git-for-vs]
  - [Git integration in Jetbrains IDEs][git-intellij]

In addition, if you are new to git or unfamiliar with the command
line, [the GitHub Desktop GUI client is great for beginners.][github-desktop]

# Guides For Getting Started

You'll first want to install git. [Refer to the official documentation for instructions on how to install git on Windows, Linux or mac.][installing-git]

There are many guides out there for getting started with git, that explain it
more effectively and in depth than we can here. Here are links to some of
those guides.
