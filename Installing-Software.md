Installing software that you think you'll need is a great way to prepare for a
hackathon, since time is precious.

This guide lists where to go to install software that you may want for the event.

# Python

[Python3 is the way to go for developing new software, since Python2.7 will no longer be maintained past Jan 1, 2020.][rip-py-2.7]

### Which version do I install?

Either Python3.5 or Python3.6 are usually fine. Most linux distros will already
have 3.5 installed.

## Windows and Mac

[The latest version of Python3.X can be downloaded from it's official downloads page.][python-downloads]

## Linux

You very likely already have a version of Python 3 installed. You can check using
`python --version` or `python3 --version`.

Otherwise, [you can also find installation instructions on the Python website.][python-downloads]

of projects. If you are working with C#, it's your best option.
