# 2018 ACM Hackathon Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the 2018 ACM Hackathon!

Please be sure to view [the site hosted on GitHub pages.][docs-link]

Here you can find guides and information that you may want to know
before the event begins so that you can show up prepared.
In addition, we will also provide explanations and walkthroughs of how
to create your first bot in a number of chat platforms and a number
of different languages.

Have fun, and happy hacking!
