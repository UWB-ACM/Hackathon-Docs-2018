## Distachi Bot

 - [Discatchi Bot Repository][discatchi-bot]

Discatchi is a discrod bot that functions as a communal pet game. Inspired by the popular keychain pets
from the late 90's, Discatchi players can earn pets, level up, and interact with their pets. Built using Python
and SQLite, players can interact with other players' pets on the same Discord server, and interact with their
pets on any other server that has the Discatchi bot. Thanks to SQLite, if the server running the bot ever
goes down, users' progress will not be lost.
