Participants of the Hackathon made some awesome projects! Here we show off
the wonderful work that was done during the sprint. Projects were submitted
to us via email and are listed here in alphabetical order.

## Distachi Bot

 - [Discatchi Bot Repository][discatchi-bot]

Discatchi is a discrod bot that functions as a communal pet game. Inspired by the popular keychain pets
from the late 90's, Discatchi players can earn pets, level up, and interact with their pets. Built using Python
and SQLite, players can interact with other players' pets on the same Discord server, and interact with their
pets on any other server that has the Discatchi bot. Thanks to SQLite, if the server running the bot ever
goes down, users' progress will not be lost.

## Grammar Bot

 - [Grammar Bot Repository][grammar-bot]

The bot has two features:
First, if you type: "thesaurus look" or any word in the place of "look", it will fetch the synonyms for you.
Second: It critiques every grammar mistake you make (in a very sassy way). See the screen shots below
for examples! It only catches a few types of grammatical errors in it's current state, but those errors are
some of the most common ones.

Here are some screen shots:
