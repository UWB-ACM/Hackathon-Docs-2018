If you are stuck for ideas on what to do for the Hackathon,
here's a handy list of some APIs (and libraries) that
can get you started with ideas.

**Discord**

API Documentation: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro

The Discord API has a list of community-made libraries,
[for a lot of languages which are listed here.](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/community-resources)

Some libraries of interest from this list are:

- Discord.NET (C#) https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net
- discord.js https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js
- discord.py https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

**Twitter**

API Documentation: https://developer.twitter.com/

[List of libraries, either made by Twitter or by community.](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries)

Libraries of interest from this list are:

- hbc (Java) https://github.com/twitter/hbc
- tweepy (Python) https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy

**Spotify**

API Documentation: https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

[List of libraries.](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/libraries/)

Libraries of interest from this list are:

- spotipy (python) https://github.com/plamere/spotipy

**Google**

Google has a _lot_ of APIs, so it's just best to see what they have and start
from there: https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/
