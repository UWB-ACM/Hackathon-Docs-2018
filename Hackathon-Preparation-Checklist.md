Whether you're a hackathon newbie or a 10x "Unicorn",
you might want to refer to this list while preparing
to attend the hackathon.

## Several Days Beforehand

Several days before the event is a great time
to start getting ready. Don't worry, you won't have
to do much!

- Start brainstorming ideas!
  - Ideas can be the _hardest part_ of a hackathon,
  so start thinking of project ideas early.
  Try to focus on projects that you believe
  are reasonably feasible in the time that you have.
  Hackathons are all about learning new things,
  but having a basis to start from can help a lot.
- Test out the languages, software, and services that
  you think you might use.
  - Some programming languages and tools require
  installation of large packages beforehand. During a
  time crunch, installing software is the last thing
  you want to be doing. [Check this guide for a reference of what to install.][installing-software]
    - If it's been a while, try out a "Hello World",
    just to ensure your development environment works.
  - Signing up for online services like GitHub, AWS,
  or whatever else you may use can eat up valuable
  hackathon time that could be better used elsewhere.
- Update the software on your machine, and ensure that
  it still works. This is always a good idea, but by
  doing this a few days in advance you'll have time
  to fix your system should issues arise.

## The Day Before

The day before the hackathon, you may still want to
double check the items from the previous list.

- Charge your devices, including laptop(s), phones,
  and battery packs.
- (Optional) Set up a sweet mixtape/playlist to listen
  to during the event.

### What to bring

- Laptop(s), Power Cables, USB Cables, Mouse, (Mechanical) Keyboard, HDMI Cable
  - Adapter Cables to full-size HDMI, USB
- A flash drive (for slides or quick file sharing)
- (Charged) Phone + Charger
- Headphones
- Water bottle
- Toiletries / Comfy clothes (still can be useful for a single-day event)

Some hardware, like Raspberry Pis and the required components to use
them will be provided to you.
